  "general_advisory": "Based on five days weather forecast received from IMD, farmers can resume agronomic practices, application pesticides and fertilizers from Thursday. Apply balanced and appropriate fertilizers according to crop’s growth stage. Avoid excess nitrogen as it promotes excessive vegetative growth and increase water demand. Always consider an integrated approach of preventive measures together with biological treatment if available to protect the crop from pests. Extensive insecticide use can lead to resistance in the pest. Topping (cutting of terminal bud of the main stem) should be done at 90 DAS or when the crop attains 100 cm height in cotton crop.",
