Farmers are advised to do proper arrangement for storing rainwater at one portion in the field. This water can be used for irrigation in the crops during dry spell. Due to high humidity, possibilities of pest and disease build up in already sown crops. Take plant protection measures depending on the crop and weather conditions. Make proper drainage system in non-paddy crop fields for removing excess water.",
